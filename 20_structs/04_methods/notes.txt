(p person) is the "receiver"
it is another parameter
not idiomatic to use "this" or "self"

"Not many people know this, but method notation, i.e. v.Method() is actually syntactic sugar and Go also understands the de-sugared
version of it: (T).Method(v). You can see an example here. Naming the receiver like any other parameter reflects that it is, in
fact, just another parameter quite well.
This also implies that the receiver-argument inside a method may be nil. This is not the case with this in e.g. Java."
